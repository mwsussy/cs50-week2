# CS50 Week 2: Arrays

This repository contains my solutions for the **CS50 Week 2** assignments. In this week, we explored arrays and implemented programs involving text analysis, cryptography, and algorithmic thinking.

## üîç Problems Covered

1. **Readability**
   - Analyzes the readability of text using the Coleman-Liau index.
   - Calculates grade level based on sentence, word, and letter counts.

2. **Caesar**
   - Implements Caesar cipher encryption.
   - Uses command-line arguments for the encryption key.

3. **Substitution**
   - Implements a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
   - Checks key validity and preserves case.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Language: C
- IDE: CS50 Lab / Visual Studio Code (via [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev))
- Tools: `make`, `clang`, CS50 Library

*Also learned how to do a code of alphabetical.c
